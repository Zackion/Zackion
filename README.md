Yo what the "hell" is updog?, folks!

On my one project, you can compress urls fre and anonymously.
However, mine actually compress your urll,
Not just creates a short link with a randomly assigned url.
Check it out here: Zackion.github.io/index.html

The advantages of my site is that your url is not stored in a databse,
So it's 100% anonymous.
